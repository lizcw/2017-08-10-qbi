  aims to help researchers get their work done
  in less time and with less pain
  by teaching them basic research computing skills.
  This hands-on workshop will cover basic programming concepts at an introductory level in a supportive and non-judgemental environment. The course includes data analysis, data visualisation and basic script design for creating reproducible code.   We also provide an introduction to using the Unix-style command-line and managing code versions in Git. Participants are encouraged to help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.
